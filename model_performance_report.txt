4. Model Evaluation
------------------
The model's performance metrics indicate:
- The model successfully learned to reconstruct normal patterns
- All samples were correctly identified as normal (benign)
- This is expected behavior since we only used benign data for training

5. Strengths
-----------
- Efficient feature extraction through convolutional layers
- Robust to noise in the input data
- Can capture complex patterns in power system measurements
- Automatic feature learning without manual feature engineering
- Good reconstruction capability for normal patterns

6. Limitations
-------------
- Currently only trained on benign data
- No evaluation on actual anomalies
- May need adjustment of threshold for real-world applications
- Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1) are not meaningful without anomaly data

7. Recommendations
-----------------
1. Data Collection:
   - Collect labeled anomaly data
   - Include various types of anomalies
   - Maintain balanced dataset

2. Model Improvements:
   - Implement cross-validation
   - Add more diverse anomaly types
   - Fine-tune threshold based on domain knowledge
   - Consider ensemble methods

3. Practical Applications:
   - Real-time monitoring of power systems
   - Early warning system for anomalies
   - Integration with existing power system monitoring tools

8. Conclusion
------------
The convolutional autoencoder shows promising results in learning normal patterns from the power system data. The model successfully reconstructs normal measurements with low error, which is the first step in anomaly detection. However, to make this model production-ready, it needs to be evaluated with actual anomaly data and possibly fine-tuned based on specific requirements of the power system monitoring task.

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for anomaly detection in power systems, but further development and testing with real anomaly data are necessary to fully assess its practical utility.

9. Future Work
-------------
1. Collect and incorporate anomaly data
2. Implement more sophisticated threshold selection methods
3. Add real-time monitoring capabilities
4. Develop a user interface for monitoring
5. Integrate with existing power system monitoring infrastructure
6. Perform comparative analysis with other anomaly detection methods

Note: This report is based on the current implementation using only benign data. The model's true performance in detecting anomalies can only be assessed once it is tested with actual anomaly data.
