        **1. Graph Autoencoders (GAE/VGAE):**
        - Use Graph Autoencoders or Variational Graph Autoencoders to learn node or graph-level embeddings in an unsupervised manner.
        - Effective for anomaly detection by reconstructing node features or adjacency matrices.
        
        **2. Contrastive Learning for Graphs:**
        - Apply self-supervised contrastive learning (e.g., GraphCL, DGI) to learn robust graph representations without labels.
        - Use data augmentations and maximize agreement between different views of the same graph.
        
        **3. Clustering-Based Anomaly Detection:**
        - Use unsupervised clustering (e.g., k-means, spectral clustering) on learned embeddings from GNNs or autoencoders.
        - Flag outliers based on distance or cluster size.
        
        **4. Hybrid Approaches:**
        - Combine unsupervised GNNs with traditional anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) on the learned representations.
        
        **5. Temporal/Sequential Modeling (if data available):**
        - If your dataset includes time-series information, consider using RNNs, LSTMs, or Temporal GNNs in an unsupervised setting.
        - Use sequence autoencoders or temporal graph networks to model normal behavior and detect deviations.
        
        **Unique Contribution Suggestions:**
        - Transfer Learning for Graphs: Train your unsupervised model on one topology or attack scenario and test its generalization on another (cross-domain anomaly detection).
        - Explainability: Integrate explainable AI techniques to interpret why certain samples are flagged as anomalies.
        - Benchmarking: Provide a comprehensive comparison with classical and deep learning baselines, highlighting where your approach excels.
        
        **Next Actions:**
        1. Implement a Graph Autoencoder (GAE/VGAE) for your dataset.
        2. Experiment with contrastive learning for graph representations.
        3. Benchmark these models against your current unsupervised GNN and CNN.
        4. Document findings and iterate based on results.
