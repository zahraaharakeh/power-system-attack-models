Unsupervised GCN Model Results
=============================

Dataset Information:
Total samples: 482
Training samples: 385
Test samples: 97

Model Configuration:
- Architecture: GCN Autoencoder
- Hidden dimensions: 64 -> 32 -> 16 -> 32 -> 64
- Activation: ReLU
- Dropout: 0.2

Training Details:
Final training loss: 0.139239
Final validation loss: 0.028891
Number of epochs trained: 1001

Anomaly Detection Results:
Reconstruction Error Threshold: 0.133923
  - 95th percentile of reconstruction errors
  - Samples with errors above this are considered anomalous

Number of anomalies detected: 5
  - Count of samples classified as anomalous

Anomaly detection rate: 0.0515
  - Proportion of samples classified as anomalous
  - Expected to be around 0.05 (5%) with 95th percentile threshold

Error Statistics:
Mean reconstruction error: 0.033472
  - Average reconstruction error across all samples

Std reconstruction error: 0.065083
  - Standard deviation of reconstruction errors

Interpretation:
1. The model learns to reconstruct normal patterns in the data
2. Anomalies are detected when reconstruction error is high
3. The threshold is set to identify the top 5% of errors as anomalies
4. Lower mean reconstruction error indicates better model performance
