**Key Achievements:**

- **Comprehensive Model Comparison**: We've created a detailed comparative analysis of all models, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different scenarios
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implemented automated tuning for GNN and GCN models, significantly improving their performance
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes all model results, performance metrics, and comparisons
- **Robust Evaluation Framework**: Established consistent evaluation metrics across all models for fair comparison

**Current Focus - Autoencoder Development:**

We are currently dedicating significant effort to advancing our Convolutional Autoencoder implementation. This work includes:

- **Architecture Refinement**: Optimizing the encoder-decoder structure for better feature extraction
- **Threshold Optimization**: Developing sophisticated methods for anomaly detection thresholds
- **Performance Enhancement**: Improving reconstruction accuracy and anomaly detection sensitivity
- **Integration Planning**: Preparing the autoencoder for integration with our overall detection framework

**Technical Infrastructure:**

- All models are implemented in Python using PyTorch and scikit-learn
- Comprehensive documentation and performance reports generated
- Automated training and evaluation pipelines established
- Results visualization and comparison tools developed

**Next Steps:**

1. Complete autoencoder optimization and integration
2. Conduct cross-validation studies across all models
3. Implement ensemble methods combining multiple approaches
4. Develop real-time monitoring capabilities
5. Prepare comprehensive research paper

**Data and Methodology:**

We're using the IEEE 14-bus test system data with features including active power (Pd_new), reactive power (Qd_new), voltage magnitude (Vm), and voltage angle (Va). Our approach combines both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to address different attack detection scenarios.

I would be happy to provide more detailed technical information about any specific aspect of our work or discuss the implications of our findings for power system security.
